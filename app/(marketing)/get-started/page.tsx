THE THREE DAYPARTS

Breakfast (7:00 AM - 11:00 AM)
• Audience: Early risers, commuters, morning coffee crowd
• Best for: Coffee shops, breakfast spots, morning services
• Typical traffic: Moderate
• Often lowest price

Lunch (11:00 AM - 3:00 PM)
• Audience: Lunch crowd, shoppers, midday visitors
• Best for: Restaurants, retail, services
• Typical traffic: Highest
• Often premium pricing

Evening (5:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
• Audience: After-work crowd, dinner guests, evening visitors
• Best for: Restaurants, bars, entertainment, evening services
• Typical traffic: High
• Often premium pricing

HOW DAYPARTS WORK
When you book a daypart, your ad plays during those hours:
• You can book one, two, or all three dayparts
• Your ad rotates with other content/ads in that time slot
• Each daypart is priced separately

BOOKING STRATEGY
• Testing: Start with one daypart for one week
• Growing: Add more dayparts based on results
• Maximum reach: Book all three dayparts

Tip: Lunch often has the highest foot traffic, but Evening has a more engaged audience (people relaxing vs. rushing).`,

        content: `Your ad will be viewed from 5-15 feet away for 10-15 seconds. Design accordingly!

DO'S

✓ Use bold, high-contrast colors
Your ad competes with a busy environment. Make it pop.

✓ Keep text to 7 words or less
People glance, they don't read. "50% Off This Week" beats a paragraph.

✓ Make your logo prominent
Brand recognition matters. Logo should be clearly visible.

✓ Include a clear call-to-action
Tell viewers what to do: "Visit us today!", "Scan for 20% off"

✓ Use high-resolution images
Blurry ads look unprofessional. Use 1920x1080 minimum.

✓ Consider adding a QR code
Makes it easy for viewers to take action immediately.

DON'TS

✗ Don't use tiny fonts
If you can't read it from 10 feet away, it's too small.

✗ Don't cram too much information
One message, one offer, one CTA.

✗ Don't use low-resolution images
Pixelated images hurt your brand.

✗ Don't forget your branding
Every ad should clearly identify your business.

✗ Don't use busy backgrounds
Simple backgrounds let your message shine.

THE 10-FOOT TEST
Step 10 feet away from your computer screen. Can you:
• Read all text?
• Identify your brand?
• Understand the offer?

If not, simplify your design!`,

TRACKING METHODS

1. Unique Promo Code
Create a promo code just for this campaign:
"COFFEE20" for 20% off
Display it in your ad
Track redemptions

2. QR Code
Add a QR code to your ad
Link to a unique landing page
Track scans and conversions

3. "How did you hear about us?"
Ask new customers directly
Train staff to ask
Track responses in a simple spreadsheet

4. Compare Sales Data
Note your baseline sales before the campaign
Compare during and after
Look for increases during your ad dayparts

CALCULATING ROI

Simple formula:
ROI = (Revenue from campaign - Cost) / Cost × 100%

Example:
• Campaign cost: $100/week
• New customers attributed: 10
• Average customer value: $25
• Revenue: $250
• ROI: ($250 - $100) / $100 = 150%

WHAT'S A GOOD ROI?
• 100%+ = Great, scale up
• 50-100% = Good, keep testing
• 0-50% = Okay, try optimizing
• Negative = Try different venues/dayparts

OPTIMIZATION TIPS
• Test different creatives
• Try different dayparts
• Focus budget on best-performing venues
• Run for at least 2 weeks before making decisions`,

        content: `MISTAKE 1: Too much text
Problem: Cramming your entire menu into one ad
Fix: One message, one offer, 7 words or less

MISTAKE 2: Wrong audience
Problem: Advertising steaks at a vegan cafe
Fix: Research venue audience before booking

MISTAKE 3: No call-to-action
Problem: Beautiful ad but no next step
Fix: Always tell viewers what to do: "Visit today", "Scan to save"

MISTAKE 4: Giving up too early
Problem: Running ads for 3 days and expecting results
Fix: Run for at least 2 weeks, ideally 4

MISTAKE 5: Not tracking results
Problem: "I think it's working maybe"
Fix: Use promo codes, QR codes, or ask customers

MISTAKE 6: Set and forget
Problem: Same ad running for months
Fix: Refresh creative monthly, adjust based on data

MISTAKE 7: Wrong daypart
Problem: Advertising breakfast items in the evening
Fix: Match your offer to the time of day

MISTAKE 8: Ignoring the 10-foot rule
Problem: Tiny text nobody can read
Fix: Test your ad from 10 feet away

MISTAKE 9: No branding
Problem: Great offer but who is it from?
Fix: Logo and business name must be prominent

MISTAKE 10: Choosing venues by price alone
Problem: Cheapest venues with no relevant audience
Fix: Prioritize audience fit over price`,
