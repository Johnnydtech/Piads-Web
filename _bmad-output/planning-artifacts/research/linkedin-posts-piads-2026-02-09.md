# PiAds LinkedIn Posts — Ready to Publish

## Post 1 — Origin Story

---

I walked every block of Clarendon last week.

I counted 47 TVs in coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, salons, and barbershops.

Here's what was on them:

- 23 showing CNN or ESPN on mute
- 11 completely turned off
- 8 showing screensavers or frozen input screens
- 4 playing YouTube playlists
- 1 showing an actual menu

47 screens. 1 doing something useful for the business.

Every one of those venue owners pays $50-70/month for cable that nobody watches. That's $2,800/month in wasted spend across one corridor.

Meanwhile, the dentist down the street is paying $500/month on Google Ads trying to reach the exact people sitting in those coffee shops.

The venue has the audience. The local business has the budget. Nobody connected them.

That's why I built PiAds.

We turn those idle venue TVs into digital signage displays — for free. Venue owners show their own content (menus, schedules, events). And when they're ready, local businesses can advertise on those screens for $50-75/week.

The venue earns 75% of the ad revenue. The advertiser reaches real people in their corridor. The screen finally does something useful.

No enterprise contracts. No expensive hardware. A $30 Fire TV Stick and 10 minutes.

We're starting in Arlington because no city has better corridors for this — Clarendon, Ballston, Columbia Pike, National Landing. Walkable. Dense with independent businesses. Community-minded.

If you own a venue in Arlington with a TV on the wall, I'd love to show you what that screen could be doing instead.

## Post 2 — The Math (ICP Framework)

---

The math on local advertising is broken. Let me show you.

A dentist in Arlington spends $500/month on Google Ads.

Here's what that gets them:

→ Average CPC: $6-8
→ Clicks: ~65-80
→ Conversion rate: 2-3%
→ New patients: 1-2
→ Cost per new patient: $250-500

Now here's the same dentist on a venue screen:

→ 3 screens in their corridor: $200-300/month
→ Daily impressions per screen: 200-400
→ Monthly impressions: 18,000-36,000
→ Repeat exposure to regulars: 15-20x/month
→ Every viewer is physically in the corridor, 5 min walk away
→ The ad appears inside a venue the viewer chose to visit

One channel gives you clicks from strangers who might be 12 miles away.

The other puts your name in front of your actual neighbors, repeatedly, in places they trust.

And here's the part nobody talks about:

When someone sees your ad in their favorite coffee shop, it feels like a recommendation — not an ad. The venue's relationship with the customer transfers to you.

That trust doesn't show up in a CPM calculation. But it shows up when a new patient says "I saw your ad at the coffee shop on Wilson Blvd."

68% of businesses say they feel they waste money on digital ads. CPCs are up 15-30% heading into 2026.

There's a better way to reach your neighbors.

## Post 3 — Customer Conversation Narrative

---

A coffee shop owner in Arlington told me something last week that I can't stop thinking about.

She said: "I pay $70 a month for cable. Nobody watches it. But I can't just turn the TV off — it makes the space feel dead."

So she's spending $840/year to make sure a screen shows... something. Anything.

I asked her: what if that screen showed your menu instead?

She said she'd tried. Bought a USB stick, made a slideshow, but it got stuck on one slide and she couldn't update it without climbing on a chair and pulling the stick out.

So she went back to cable.

We set her up with PiAds in about 10 minutes. Fire TV Stick. Free account. She uploaded her menu photos from her phone.

Within a day she texted me:

"Three customers today ordered the lavender latte. We've had it for months and nobody ever noticed it on the paper menu."

She cancelled cable the next morning.

That's the part people miss about digital signage. It's not about advertising. It's about helping a business communicate better with the customers already standing in front of them.

The ad revenue is a bonus. The real value is a screen that actually works for the business.

If you own a coffee shop, restaurant, gym, or salon — your screen should be earning its keep. Not costing you $70/month to show ESPN on mute.

## Post 4 — Hot Take / Industry Insight

---

Unpopular opinion: Billboards are the worst way to advertise a local business.

I know — they look impressive. Your logo, 14 feet tall, on the highway. Your mom takes a photo of it.

But here's what actually happens:

→ A billboard on Route 50 near Arlington gets ~30,000 daily impressions
→ 95% of those people are commuters who will never visit your business
→ Average attention span: 3-5 seconds at 45 mph
→ Cost: $200-500/week for one board
→ Attribution: zero. You have no idea if it worked.

Now compare that to a screen inside a coffee shop in your corridor:

→ 200-400 daily impressions from people who are physically in your neighborhood
→ Average dwell time: 20-60 minutes
→ Repeat exposure: regulars see your ad 15-20x per month
→ Cost: $50-75/week
→ Attribution: "I saw your ad at the coffee shop on Wilson Blvd"

One reaches commuters driving through.
The other reaches neighbors sitting down.

The billboard industry is a $9B market built on the assumption that more impressions = more customers.

But for a dentist, yoga studio, or tutoring center that serves a 3-mile radius? You don't need 30,000 impressions. You need 300 of the right ones.

Indoor venue screens are the most undervalued advertising channel in local marketing right now.

The businesses that figure this out first will own their corridors.

## Post 5 — Behind the Scenes / Build in Public

---

Month 1 of building PiAds in Arlington. Here's what I've learned so far:

**What venue owners actually care about (not what I expected):**

I thought the pitch was "earn money from your TV screen."

Wrong.

The thing that makes venue owners say yes:

"Wait — I can show my own menu on this? For free?"

They don't care about ad revenue yet. They care about replacing their paper menu, updating their class schedule without printing new sheets, and showing their events calendar on a screen people actually look at.

The ad marketplace is a Phase 2 conversation. Phase 1 is: make their screen useful.

**What surprised me about Arlington:**

→ The BIDs (Business Improvement Districts) in Rosslyn, Ballston, and National Landing are actively looking for new tools to support local businesses. They're not bureaucratic gatekeepers — they're connectors.

→ 31% of Arlington residents work from home. That means coffee shops and co-working spaces are packed during business hours. Daytime venue traffic is higher than I expected.

→ Business owners here genuinely know each other. When one coffee shop owner likes something, three others hear about it by Friday.

**What I got wrong:**

I spent two weeks building pitch decks before realizing that walking into a venue with a Fire TV Stick and saying "can I show you something?" converts better than any email or slide.

The product sells itself when you can see it on a real screen in 10 minutes.

**Next month's focus:** Get 15 venue screens live in Clarendon. If you know an Arlington venue owner who might be interested, I'd appreciate an intro. DM me.
