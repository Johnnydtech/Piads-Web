# PiAds Instagram Posts — Ready to Produce

## Post 1 — Reel: "The $30 Transformation"

### Format: Reel (60 seconds)

### Concept
Show the transformation of an idle venue TV into a working PiAds digital signage screen. Quick, satisfying, before/after energy.

### Video Storyboard

```
Scene 1 (0-5s): Close-up of a TV on a wall showing CNN on mute. Camera slowly zooms out to reveal a coffee shop. Text overlay: "This screen costs $70/month"

Scene 2 (5-10s): Cut to a hand holding up a Fire TV Stick. Text overlay: "This costs $30"

Scene 3 (10-18s): Quick montage — plugging Fire TV Stick into the TV HDMI port, connecting to WiFi on a phone, opening the PiAds dashboard on a laptop, uploading a menu image

Scene 4 (18-25s): The TV transforms — CNN disappears, a beautiful coffee shop menu appears with photos of lattes and pastries. Camera pulls back to show customers looking up at it.

Scene 5 (25-35s): Time-lapse style — the screen cycles through: morning menu → lunch specials → local business ad (dentist) → evening events calendar. Text overlay: "Your content. Your schedule. Your revenue."

Scene 6 (35-45s): Split screen comparison:
Left side: "BEFORE — $70/mo cable, nobody watches"
Right side: "AFTER — free signage + $300/mo ad revenue"

Scene 7 (45-55s): Pull back to wide shot of the coffee shop with the screen glowing, customers engaged. Text overlay: "10 minutes to set up. $0 to start."

Scene 8 (55-60s): PiAds logo + "Link in bio" + piads.co
```

      "prompt": "Cinematic close-up of a flat screen TV mounted on a warm brick wall inside a cozy modern coffee shop, displaying CNN news on mute with closed captions. The screen looks out of place. Natural warm lighting, shallow depth of field, slight camera zoom out revealing the cafe interior with wooden tables and customers in the background. Shot on iPhone aesthetic, handheld feel."

### Caption

```
Your coffee shop TV is costing you $70/month to show CNN to nobody.

Here's what happens when you replace cable with a $30 Fire TV Stick and free digital signage:

→ Your menu actually gets seen
→ Customers discover items they didn't know you had
→ Your schedule, events, and promos rotate automatically
→ Local businesses pay YOU to advertise on your screen
→ You keep 75% of the ad revenue

Total setup time: 10 minutes.
Total cost: $30 (you already have the TV).
Monthly cable bill after: $0.

One coffee shop owner told us 3 customers ordered the lavender latte the first day — a drink that had been on the paper menu for months with zero orders.

Your screen is already on the wall. Make it work for you.

## Post 2 — Carousel: "The Math That Changed Everything"

### Format: Carousel (7 slides)

### Concept
Data-driven comparison between Google Ads and venue screen advertising for a local business. Clean, bold graphics that make the numbers impossible to ignore.

### Slide Descriptions

**Slide 1 (Hook/Cover):**
- Bold text on a dark background (navy or black)
- Headline: "Google Ads vs. Venue Screens"
- Subhead: "The math your dentist needs to see"
- Small PiAds logo in corner
- Design: minimal, high contrast, large sans-serif font

**Slide 2 (Google Ads breakdown):**
- Title: "Google Ads: $500/month"
- List with icons:
  - 💰 Average CPC: $6-8
  - 👆 Clicks: 65-80
  - 📉 Conversion rate: 2-3%
  - 👤 New patients: 1-2
  - 🔥 Cost per patient: $250-500
- Red/warning color accent
- Bottom text: "And 97% of clicks go nowhere."

**Slide 3 (Venue Screen breakdown):**
- Title: "Venue Screens: $200-300/month"
- List with icons:
  - 📍 3 screens in your corridor
  - 👀 18,000-36,000 monthly impressions
  - 🔄 Regulars see your ad 15-20x/month
  - 🚶 Every viewer is in your neighborhood
  - 🏪 Your ad is inside venues they trust
- Green/positive color accent
- Bottom text: "Every impression is a real person in your corridor."

**Slide 4 (The trust factor):**
- Title: "The part CPM can't measure"
- Visual: simple illustration of a coffee shop with a screen showing a dentist ad
- Text: "When your ad appears inside someone's favorite coffee shop, it feels like a recommendation — not an ad."
- Subtext: "That trust is worth more than 10,000 highway impressions."

**Slide 5 (The comparison visual):**
- Side by side:
  - Left: "Google Ad" — a phone screen showing a search result (impersonal, one of many)
  - Right: "Venue Screen" — a TV in a cozy coffee shop showing the dentist ad (warm, trusted)
- Bottom: "Which one would you trust more?"

**Slide 6 (The stat):**
- Large bold stat: "68%"
- Subtext: "of businesses feel they waste money on digital ads"
- Source citation small at bottom
- Text: "There's a better way to reach your neighbors."

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
- "Stop paying for clicks from strangers."
- "Start reaching the people in your corridor."
- PiAds logo
- "Link in bio → piads.co"
- Clean, confident design

### Image Creation Notes
- Create in Canva at 1080x1350px (4:5 ratio, best for Instagram feed)
- Use PiAds brand colors if established, otherwise navy/white/green
- Sans-serif font (Inter, Montserrat, or DM Sans)
- Keep text large and readable on mobile
- Each slide should make sense on its own (people screenshot individual slides)

```
The math on local advertising is broken.

A local dentist spending $500/month on Google Ads gets:
→ 65-80 clicks
→ 2-3% conversion rate
→ 1-2 new patients
→ $250-500 per patient acquired

The same dentist on 3 venue screens in their corridor:
→ $200-300/month
→ 18,000-36,000 monthly impressions
→ 15-20x repeat exposure to regulars
→ Every viewer is physically in the neighborhood
→ The ad appears inside a venue they trust

One gives you clicks from strangers.
The other puts you in front of your neighbors.

68% of businesses feel they waste money on digital ads. CPCs are up 15-30% in 2026.

If you serve customers within a 3-mile radius, venue screens are the most undervalued advertising channel available right now.

Save this for when your Google Ads bill arrives next month. 📌

## Post 3 — Reel: "Walk With Me Through Clarendon"

### Format: Reel (45-60 seconds)

### Concept
A walking tour through the Clarendon corridor, pointing out venue after venue that could have (or already has) a PiAds screen. Community-first, warm, Arlington pride energy.

### Video Storyboard

```
Scene 1 (0-5s): POV walking shot down Wilson Blvd in Clarendon on a sunny morning. Text overlay: "Walk with me through Clarendon"

Scene 2 (5-12s): Camera pans to a coffee shop window. You can see a TV inside. Text overlay: "This coffee shop has 200 customers a day and a TV showing nothing"

Scene 3 (12-18s): Walk past a gym entrance. Through the glass you see screens on the wall. Text overlay: "This gym has members who come 4x a week — that's 16 ad exposures per month per person"

Scene 4 (18-25s): Pass a barbershop. A customer is sitting in the chair with a TV in front of them. Text overlay: "30-60 minutes in the chair. Captive audience."

Scene 5 (25-32s): Walk past a restaurant with a menu board. Text overlay: "Digital menus increase order value 10-15%. This one's still using paper."

Scene 6 (32-40s): Stop at a corner. Camera pans across the corridor showing 5-6 businesses visible. Text overlay: "Every one of these venues is a potential screen. Every local business is a potential advertiser."

Scene 7 (40-50s): Camera turns to face you (the founder). Speaking to camera: "This is why we're building PiAds in Arlington. Walkable corridors with dense local businesses and a community that actually supports each other. This is where venue screen networks make sense."

Scene 8 (50-60s): Walking shot continuing down the corridor. Text overlay: "piads.co — community screens for Arlington" + PiAds logo
```

### Caption

I walked every block of Clarendon this week.

Here's what I saw:

☕ Coffee shops with TVs showing cable news nobody watches
💪 Gyms with screens on the wall that could be showing class schedules + local ads
💈 Barbershops where customers sit for 45 min staring at ESPN on mute
🍽️ Restaurants with paper menus when a digital board would boost their sales 10-15%

Every one of these venues has a screen.
Every one of these venues has a captive audience.
None of them are using their screens to help their business.

Meanwhile, the dentist, the yoga studio, and the tutoring center on the same block would pay $50-75/week to reach those exact customers.

The venue has the audience. The local business has the budget. PiAds connects them.

If you own a venue in Clarendon (or Ballston, Columbia Pike, National Landing) — your TV should be working for you, not costing you.

DM me and I'll show you how in 10 minutes.

## Post 4 — Static Image / Infographic: "What Your Venue Screen Should Be Showing"

### Format: Single image (1080x1350)

### Concept
A visual daily timeline showing what a coffee shop screen should display throughout the day. Clean, useful, save-worthy content.

### Image Description

Create a vertical infographic (1080x1350px) with the following layout:

**Header:**
- Title: "What Your Coffee Shop Screen Should Be Showing"
- Subtitle: "A daily content schedule for your venue TV"
- PiAds logo small in corner

**Timeline (main body):**
Visual timeline running vertically down the image with time blocks and icons:

```
☀️  7AM - 11AM | BREAKFAST
    → Morning menu with featured drinks
    → Today's pastry selection with photos
    → WiFi password + social handles

☕  11AM - 2PM | MIDDAY
    → Lunch specials with images
    → Local business ads (dentist, yoga studio)
    → Community events this weekend

🌤️  2PM - 5PM | AFTERNOON
    → Catering services promo
    → Rotating local business ads
    → Instagram feed or reviews showcase

🌙  5PM - CLOSE | EVENING
    → Evening drink specials
    → Live music or events schedule
    → "See you tomorrow" with next-day preview
```

**Footer:**
- "Your screen is already on the wall. Make it work for you."
- "Free setup → piads.co"
- PiAds logo

**Design Notes:**
- Clean, modern design with warm color palette (cream background, dark text, accent colors for each time block)
- Use simple icons for each time block (sun, coffee cup, cloud, moon)
- Large enough text to read on mobile without zooming
- Make it "save-worthy" — people should want to screenshot this for reference
- Sans-serif font throughout

### Caption

```
Your venue screen has 14+ hours of airtime every day.

Here's exactly what to show and when:

☀️ MORNING (7-11am)
Your menu. Featured drinks with photos. Today's specials. This is when your screen drives the most orders. Customers discover items they didn't know you had.

☕ MIDDAY (11am-2pm)
Lunch specials + local business ads. A nearby yoga studio promotes their lunchtime class. A dentist two blocks away runs a cleaning special. You earn ad revenue during this slot.

🌤️ AFTERNOON (2-5pm)
Your catering services, social handles, and more local ads. This is dead time for your menu — monetize it.

🌙 EVENING (5pm-close)
Drink specials. Live music schedule. Upcoming events. Set the mood for the evening crowd.

The best part? With PiAds, you schedule this once and it runs automatically. Update from your phone in 30 seconds.

Your content. Your schedule. Your revenue.

Save this for when you're ready to upgrade your screen game. 📌

## Post 5 — Reel: "Why Your Neighbors Trust Venue Screens More Than Ads"

### Format: Reel (30-40 seconds)

### Concept
A quick, punchy reel about the trust difference between digital ads and venue screen ads. Uses the "talking head + text overlay" format that performs well on Instagram.

### Video Storyboard

```
Scene 1 (0-3s): Speaking to camera, energetic. "Here's why a $50/week venue screen ad beats a $500/month Google Ad for local businesses."

Scene 2 (3-8s): Cut to B-roll of someone scrolling past ads on their phone quickly. Text overlay: "Google Ad → you're one of 10 results they scroll past"

Scene 3 (8-13s): Cut to B-roll of someone sitting in a coffee shop, looking up at a TV screen. Text overlay: "Venue screen → you're in their favorite spot, for 30 minutes"

Scene 4 (13-18s): Back to camera. "When your ad shows up in someone's Google search, you're competing with 9 other businesses. When your ad shows up inside their favorite coffee shop — you're the only one they see."

Scene 5 (18-25s): Cut to B-roll of a friendly coffee shop interior with a screen showing a local business ad. Text overlay: "76% of people who discover something nearby visit within 24 hours"

Scene 6 (25-32s): Back to camera. "The coffee shop already earned their trust. Your ad borrows that trust. That's something no algorithm can replicate."

Scene 7 (32-40s): Text on screen: "Stop paying for clicks. Start showing up where your neighbors already are." + PiAds logo + "Link in bio"
```

}
```

### Caption

```
A Google Ad puts you in a list of 10 businesses someone scrolls past in 2 seconds.

A venue screen puts you inside the coffee shop they visit every morning for 30 minutes.

One is a search result. The other is a neighbor's recommendation.

Here's why that matters:

→ 76% of people who discover something nearby visit within 24 hours
→ Venue regulars see your ad 15-20x per month (try getting that frequency on Google)
→ The venue owner approved your ad — it's an implicit endorsement
→ You can literally walk in and see your ad on the screen

When someone says "I saw your ad at the coffee shop on Wilson Blvd" — that's not a click. That's trust.

You can't buy trust with a higher CPC. But you can earn it by showing up in the right places.
