# PiAds Social Media Strategy — Building Quality Online Presence

## Research Context

PiAds is a two-sided marketplace (venue owners + advertisers) with community-first positioning in a hyperlocal market (Arlington VA corridors). This shapes everything — PiAds is not selling SaaS to enterprise buyers or DTC products to consumers. It's building a local community network. The social strategy should reflect that.

---

## Platform Priority Ranking

### 1. LinkedIn — #1 Channel (Must-Have)

**Why:** 80% of all B2B social media leads come from LinkedIn. It generates 277% more leads than Facebook and Twitter combined. PiAds' targets — venue owners (business owners) and local advertisers (decision-makers at small businesses) — are on LinkedIn.

**What works in 2026:**

- **Founder-led content is the play.** At early-stage, the founder's personal profile will outperform any company page. Employee-shared content reaches 561% more people than company pages. Post from the founder's account, not PiAds'.
- **7 proven formats** (per LinkedIn creator Tommy Clark):
  1. **Origin story** — why PiAds was built, the insight about idle venue screens
  2. **Monthly updates** — 3 wins + 3 learnings, with a photo
  3. **Customer conversation narratives** — "talked to a coffee shop owner who..."
  4. **ICP frameworks** — "The $520/month math: how a venue screen replaces cable"
  5. **Behind-the-scenes** — corridor walks, venue setups, screen installs
  6. **Hot takes** — "Google Ads are failing local businesses and here's the data"
  7. **Industry insights** — share DOOH trends, rising CPC data, venue screen stats
- **Multi-image carousels get 6.60% engagement rate** — highest of any LinkedIn format. Use these for data breakdowns, before/after setups, corridor maps.

**Posting cadence:** 3-4x/week from personal profile. 1-2x/week from PiAds company page (repurpose best personal posts).

### 2. Nextdoor — Secret Weapon (Must-Have)

**Why:** The most underrated channel for PiAds. Nextdoor has 100M+ verified users across 345K neighborhoods. The stats are staggering for hyperlocal:

- **94% of neighbors trust recommendations** on Nextdoor
- **88% shop at local businesses at least weekly**
- **79% visited a business based on a Nextdoor recommendation**

PiAds' community-first model is a perfect fit. Not selling — connecting neighbors.

**What to do:**

- Claim PiAds' **free business page** on Nextdoor
- Post in **Arlington neighborhood feeds** about free digital signage for venues
- Share venue success stories and screen setups
- Engage in local business recommendation threads (when someone asks "anyone know a good way to promote my new business?")
- Use **Nextdoor Local Deals** feature for venue owners (free CMS offer)
- Community marketing > advertising: help people, don't pitch

**Key insight from research:** "Word of mouth is really big... People say 'I trust what my neighbors say.' People listen to that more than just an advertisement." This is literally PiAds' thesis applied to social media.

### 3. Instagram — Visual Proof (High Priority)

**Why:** Instagram is where PiAds *shows* the product working in real venues. It's visual proof that builds credibility. In 2026, the algorithm rewards intentional, specific content over generic volume.

**What to post:**

- **Reels (highest reach):**
  - 60-second "venue screen setup" walkthroughs
  - Before/after: blank TV → live PiAds screen with menu content
  - "Walk with me through Clarendon" corridor content showing venue screens
  - Quick tips: "3 things every coffee shop should display on their screen"
- **Carousel posts:**
  - Data graphics (the $520/month math, dwell time comparisons)
  - Venue type guides (coffee shop screen ideas, gym screen ideas)
  - "How it works" step-by-step visual walkthroughs
- **Stories:**
  - Day-in-the-life content: visiting venues, setting up screens
  - Polls and questions: "What would you want to see on your coffee shop screen?"
  - Repost venue owners showing off their screens

**2026 Instagram insight:** "The accounts that are growing and converting aren't doing more. They're doing things with more intention. Generic content isn't failing because it's bad. It's failing because it's forgettable." Content should be specific to Arlington corridors and real venues — not generic digital signage tips.

**Posting cadence:** 3-4 Reels/week, 1-2 carousels/week, daily Stories when active.

### 4. TikTok — Viral Growth Potential (Medium Priority)

**Why:** TikTok's algorithm favors new creators — even with zero followers, content can reach thousands. For a startup with no audience, this is the fastest path to organic visibility.

**What works:**

- **Setup videos:** "Watch me turn a $30 Fire TV Stick into a digital signage display in 10 minutes"
- **Venue walkthrough content:** walk into an Arlington coffee shop, show the screen, explain the model
- **Hot take / education clips:** "Your coffee shop TV is costing you $70/month to show ESPN nobody watches"
- **Before/after transformations:** paper menu vs. digital screen
- **The math:** short clips breaking down $50/week venue screen ads vs. $500/month Google Ads

**Key insight:** TikTok content can be **cross-posted to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts** with minimal editing. Create once, distribute three places.

**Posting cadence:** 3-5x/week (high volume benefits from the algorithm).

---

### 5. Facebook — Local Groups (Medium Priority)

**Why:** Not for organic brand posting (organic reach is dead on Facebook pages). But **Facebook Groups** are where Arlington business owners already congregate.

**What to do:**

- Join Arlington business owner groups, Clarendon/Ballston community groups
- Be genuinely helpful — answer questions about signage, marketing, local advertising
- Share blog posts when relevant (not spammy — only when someone asks a related question)
- Create a **PiAds Arlington Community** group once there are 20+ venue partners — this becomes a network effect tool

---

### 6. YouTube — Long-Form Authority (Lower Priority, Build Over Time)

**Why:** YouTube content has the longest shelf life of any social platform. A setup tutorial posted today will generate views for years.

**What to build:**

- "How to Set Up Digital Signage in Your Coffee Shop" (full tutorial)
- "How Much Can Your Venue Screen Earn?" (the math, walkthrough)
- "Arlington Corridor Guide for Local Advertisers"
- Venue owner interviews and testimonials
- Monthly "State of PiAds" updates

**Posting cadence:** 1-2x/month (quality over quantity).

---

## Content Strategy: The 4 Pillars

PiAds' social content should follow four themes:

| Pillar | % of Content | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Build in Public** | 30% | Founder journey, monthly updates, wins/learnings, behind-the-scenes of corridor outreach, honest reflections |
| **Educate** | 30% | How venue screens work, the math on ad costs, digital signage tips, setup guides, content ideas for venues |
| **Showcase** | 25% | Venue screen photos/videos, before/after, corridor walk content, venue owner spotlights, "look at this screen in the wild" |
| **Community** | 15% | Arlington corridor love, local business shoutouts, event promotion, BID news, neighbor recommendations |

---

## The Founder-Led Content Playbook

Research is unanimous: **at early-stage, the founder IS the brand.** Personal accounts will outperform company accounts by 5-10x.

### LinkedIn Profile Optimization

- **Headline:** Not "Founder at PiAds" — something like "Building community screen networks in Arlington | Helping venues earn from their idle TVs"
- **Banner:** PiAds branding with a venue screen photo
- **About section:** The origin story — why PiAds was built, what the founder believes about local business

### Content Formula

1. **Hook** (first line): A specific, surprising claim or question
2. **Story/Data**: Real experience or research backing the claim
3. **Insight**: What was learned or what this means
4. **CTA**: Soft (follow for more, check out piads.co, DM me) — not salesy

### Example Posts

**Post 1 — Origin Story:**
> "I walked every block of Clarendon last week and counted 47 TVs showing cable news in venues. That's 47 screens doing nothing for the business owner. Here's what they could be showing instead..."

**Post 2 — Customer Conversation:**
> "A coffee shop owner told me she pays $70/month for cable that nobody watches. We replaced it with a free digital menu board. She cancelled cable the same day."

**Post 3 — Hot Take:**
> "68% of small businesses feel they waste money on digital ads. I built PiAds because I think there's a better way to reach your neighbors."

**Post 4 — The Math:**
> "Google Ads for a local dentist: $500/month → 1-2 new patients. A venue screen in the coffee shop 200 feet from the office: $200/month → their ad seen 15-20x by every regular. The math isn't close."

**Post 5 — Behind the Scenes:**
> "Month 1 of building PiAds in Arlington. Here's what I've learned about why venue owners say yes (and what almost made them say no)..."

## Key 2026 Trends That Favor PiAds

### 1. Community Marketing Is the #1 Emerging Trend

"People are craving human connection. The rise of AI makes human touch more valuable. Companies that facilitate connection will win." — This is PiAds' entire thesis.

### 2. Consistency + Engagement = Growth

Buffer's research across 100K+ users: creators who posted consistently and engaged with their audience grew fastest. No shortcuts. The two things entirely in your control — showing up regularly and engaging with people who respond — are the biggest growth drivers.

_Source: https://buffer.com/resources/creator-growth-playbook/_

### 3. Authenticity > Polish

At early stage, "raw points of view and honest reflections do more work than aesthetics ever could." Don't wait for perfect content. A phone video of a venue screen setup is more compelling than a polished brand video.

### 4. Hyperlocal Platforms Are Rising

Nextdoor's 100M users and 94% trust rating show that hyperlocal social is where local business discovery is heading. Community-first technology is shaping small business success in 2026.

### 5. Founder-Led Content Is a No-Brainer for B2B

"It's 2026. Founder-led LinkedIn content is a no-brainer for B2B tech companies." The founder's personal brand builds trust faster than any company page or ad campaign.
