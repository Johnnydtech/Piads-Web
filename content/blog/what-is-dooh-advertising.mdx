DOOH stands for **Digital Out-of-Home advertising**. It's any digital ad displayed on a screen in a public or semi-public space—think billboards, airport screens, gas station displays, and the TV in your local cafe.

The global DOOH market is worth over $35 billion and growing at 10%+ annually. But until recently, it was dominated by large corporations buying billboard space and airport terminal ads.

That's changing. Small businesses on both sides—venue owners selling screen time and local advertisers buying it—are entering the DOOH market. Here's what you need to know.

## DOOH vs. Traditional OOH: What's the Difference?

**OOH (Out-of-Home)** is any advertising you see outside your home. Billboards, bus shelter posters, bench ads, transit wraps. It's been around for centuries.

**DOOH (Digital Out-of-Home)** is the digital version. Instead of printed posters, content runs on screens. The key differences:

| Feature | Traditional OOH | DOOH |
|---------|----------------|------|
| Content | Static print | Dynamic digital |
| Updates | Days/weeks to change | Instant, remote |
| Targeting | Location only | Location + time of day |
| Measurement | Estimated impressions | Actual play counts |
| Cost to enter | $1,000s+/month | As low as $50/week |
| Creative | One design per campaign | Multiple creatives, rotating |
| Flexibility | Long-term contracts | Book by day or week |

DOOH keeps the core advantage of OOH—real-world visibility that can't be blocked, skipped, or scrolled past—while adding the flexibility and measurability of digital.

## Types of DOOH Advertising

### Large Format

The big screens. Digital billboards along highways, building-mounted LED displays, and large-format screens in transit hubs. These are expensive and typically sold programmatically through demand-side platforms (DSPs).

- **Cost:** $1,000-50,000+/month
- **Best for:** National brands, awareness campaigns
- **Reach:** Thousands to millions of impressions

### Place-Based (Venue Screens)

Screens inside businesses—restaurants, gyms, salons, offices, retail stores. This is the fastest-growing DOOH segment because it combines location targeting with audience context.

- **Cost:** $50-500/month per screen
- **Best for:** Local businesses, hyperlocal targeting
- **Reach:** Hundreds to thousands of impressions daily

A gym screen reaches fitness enthusiasts. A cafe screen reaches the lunch crowd. A salon screen reaches people with 30-60 minutes of dwell time. The context makes the ad more relevant than a billboard seen for 3 seconds at 60mph.

### Point of Purchase

Screens at checkout counters, gas pumps, and kiosks. These reach people at the moment of purchase.

- **Cost:** Varies widely
- **Best for:** Impulse products, add-on services
- **Reach:** Moderate, but high purchase intent

## How DOOH Advertising Works

### For Advertisers (Buying Screen Time)

1. **Choose your market.** Pick the neighborhood, city, or venue type where your customers are.
2. **Select screens.** Browse available screens by location, audience type, and price.
3. **Upload your creative.** Images or videos formatted for the screen dimensions.
4. **Book your time slots.** Choose specific days and dayparts (morning, lunch, evening).
5. **Your ad runs.** Content plays in rotation on the selected screens.
6. **Review results.** See how many times your ad played and during which time slots.

### For Venue Owners (Selling Screen Time)

1. **Connect your screen.** Plug a media player into your TV and connect to the platform.
2. **Set your pricing.** Choose how much to charge per daypart.
3. **List in the marketplace.** Advertisers discover your screen and book slots.
4. **Approve ads.** You control what runs on your screen. Reject anything that doesn't fit.
5. **Get paid.** Revenue is deposited automatically. With PiAds, you keep 75%.

## Why DOOH Is Growing

### Ad Blockers Don't Work on Screens

Over 40% of internet users run ad blockers. You can't block a screen on the wall of a restaurant. DOOH delivers guaranteed visibility.

### Digital Fatigue Is Real

People are overwhelmed by online ads. The average person sees 6,000-10,000 digital ads per day. Most are ignored. A well-placed screen in a physical space cuts through because it exists in the real world where attention is less fragmented.

### Programmatic Buying Is Lowering the Barrier

Programmatic DOOH allows advertisers to buy screen time through automated platforms, similar to how Google Ads works for search. This has opened the market to smaller budgets that previously couldn't access OOH.

### Measurement Is Improving

Traditional billboards offered estimated impressions based on traffic counts. DOOH platforms provide actual play counts, time-of-day data, and increasingly, audience analytics. It's not perfect, but it's far more measurable than a poster on a wall.

## DOOH for Small Businesses: Both Sides

### If You Own a Venue

Your screens are sitting idle or showing cable TV. With a platform like PiAds, those screens become advertising inventory that local businesses will pay for.

**What you need:**
- A TV with an HDMI port
- A media player ($30-60)
- WiFi connection
- A PiAds account (free)

**What you earn:**
- Revenue from ad slots, with you setting the prices
- 75% of all ad revenue through PiAds
- Full control over what ads appear

**Best venue types for DOOH:**
- Restaurants and cafes (high foot traffic, dwell time)
- Gyms and fitness studios (captive audience, repeat visits)
- Salons and barbershops (long dwell time, affluent audience)
- Coworking spaces (professional audience)
- Retail stores (purchase-ready customers)
- Medical and dental waiting rooms (captive, extended wait)

### If You Want to Advertise

DOOH lets you put your business in front of real people in specific locations, without the complexity of running online ad campaigns.

**What you need:**
- A graphic or video ad (can be as simple as a well-designed image)
- A budget starting at $50/week
- A PiAds account

**Why it works for local businesses:**
- **Hyperlocal targeting.** Advertise in venues within walking distance of your business.
- **No bidding wars.** Unlike Google Ads, you pay a fixed rate set by the venue owner.
- **Real-world visibility.** Your ad runs on a physical screen that people can't skip.
- **Simple creative.** A clean image with your logo, offer, and contact info works fine.

**Best advertiser types for venue DOOH:**
- Local service providers (dentists, lawyers, realtors, insurance)
- Nearby restaurants and retail
- Events and promotions
- Health and wellness services
- Local delivery and home services
- Professional services (accounting, financial planning)

## DOOH Pricing: What to Expect

Pricing for place-based DOOH (venue screens) is straightforward:

| Venue Type | Per-Daypart Daily Rate | Monthly Estimate |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| High-traffic cafe | $5-15/day | $100-300 |
| Busy gym | $10-25/day | $200-500 |
| Salon/barbershop | $3-10/day | $60-200 |
| Coworking space | $5-15/day | $100-300 |
| Retail store | $3-10/day | $60-200 |

These rates are per daypart (morning, lunch, or evening). Advertisers typically book specific dayparts that align with when their target customers are present.
