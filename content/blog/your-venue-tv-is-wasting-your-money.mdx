Walk into most coffee shops, salons, barbershops, and restaurants in Arlington and look at the TV on the wall. What do you see?

CNN on mute. A screensaver. A frozen input screen. ESPN replaying the same highlight reel nobody's watching. Or worse — the TV is off entirely.

That screen is costing you money every month. Electricity. Maybe a $70 cable subscription. And it's giving you nothing in return.

Here's the thing: that same TV, with a $30 device and 10 minutes of setup, could be displaying your menu, promoting tonight's event, showing your class schedule, and — when you're ready — earning passive income from local businesses who want to reach your customers.

No enterprise contracts. No IT department. No monthly software fees.

## What Your Screen Should Be Doing

Think about everything you currently communicate with paper signs, chalkboards, table tents, and Instagram posts. Now imagine all of that on a screen your customers are already looking at.

**If you run a coffee shop:**
- Your full menu with photos of featured drinks
- Today's pastry selection (updated in 30 seconds from your phone)
- Seasonal specials that rotate automatically
- Your catering services, social handles, and upcoming events
- Community events happening in the corridor this weekend

**If you run a gym or fitness studio:**
- Today's class schedule (no more paper printouts taped to the wall)
- Upcoming workshops and special events
- Member achievements and challenge leaderboards
- New trainer introductions and service offerings

**If you run a salon or barbershop:**
- Service menu with current pricing
- Style gallery showing your best work
- Product showcases for retail items you sell
- Availability for walk-ins today

**If you run a restaurant:**
- Digital menu board that changes by daypart — breakfast items in the morning, happy hour specials at 4pm, dinner menu by 6pm
- Featured dishes with photos that make people order more (industry data shows digital menus increase average order value 10-15%)
- Tonight's live music, next week's wine dinner, your private event packages

All of this updates from a simple dashboard. Change your daily special? Takes 30 seconds. New seasonal menu? Swap out the images. Holiday hours? Schedule it to display automatically and revert back.

No more Sharpie on a whiteboard. No more printing new paper menus every time a price changes.

## The Setup Is Embarrassingly Simple

This is the part where most venue owners expect a catch. There isn't one.

**What you need:**
1. A TV (you already have one)
2. A Fire TV Stick ($30 at Best Buy) or a Raspberry Pi ($35-60)
3. WiFi (you already have this too)

**What you do:**
1. Plug the device into your TV
2. Sign up for a free PiAds venue account
3. Pair your screen in the dashboard
4. Upload your content — images, videos, or even a simple Canva design
5. Set a schedule (what plays when) and hit publish

Total setup time: 10 minutes. Total cost if you already have a TV: $30.

Your screen is now a digital signage display. It shows what you want, when you want it, and you control everything from your phone or laptop.

## Why Free? What's the Catch?

Fair question. Here's the honest answer.

PiAds gives you free digital signage software because the platform makes money when local businesses advertise on venue screens. Your screen is valuable to advertisers because your customers are a captive, local audience.

But — and this is important — **advertising is completely optional.** You can use PiAds purely as a content management tool and never show a single ad. Display your menu, your schedule, your promotions. That's it. Free forever.

If and when you decide you want to earn from your screen, you opt into the marketplace. Local businesses book time on your screen. Their ads run alongside your content. You approve every ad before it appears. And you keep **75% of the ad revenue**.

That's the model: you get a free tool that makes your venue better, and if you want to earn from it too, the option is there.

No pressure. No upsells. No "free trial that expires in 14 days."

## What Venue Owners Actually Say

The most common reaction from venue owners after setting up PiAds isn't about the ad revenue. It's about their own content.

**"I didn't realize how much better a digital menu looks."** A paper menu taped to the wall is invisible after a week. A screen with rotating photos of your best dishes gets looked at every time someone walks in. Customers order items they didn't know you had.

**"My class schedule is finally always up to date."** Gym owners and studio owners spend an unreasonable amount of time printing, reprinting, and taping paper schedules. A screen that updates in 30 seconds from a phone eliminates that entirely.

**"People actually read the screen."** This surprises owners. When the TV showed CNN, nobody watched. When it shows the venue's own content — menus, events, community info — people look up. The screen becomes part of the experience instead of background noise.

**"I stopped paying for cable."** A $70/month cable subscription showing content nobody watches vs. a free signage platform showing content that actually helps your business. The math speaks for itself.

## The Content You Already Have Is Enough

One of the biggest misconceptions about digital signage is that you need professional design skills. You don't.

**What works perfectly on a venue screen:**
- A Canva template (there are thousands of free restaurant, gym, and salon templates)
- A photo of your best dish taken on your iPhone
- A simple slide with your hours and WiFi password
- Your logo on a solid color background with today's special written in text
- A screenshot of your Instagram feed

You don't need a graphic designer. You don't need video production. You need a phone, a free Canva account, and five minutes.

The bar for "better than cable news on mute" is extremely low. Anything you create will be an improvement.

## When You're Ready: The Revenue Side

Let's say you've been running your screen for a month. Your menu looks great. Your schedule is always current. Customers compliment the screen. You're saving $70/month on cable.

Now you notice the marketplace option in your dashboard. Local businesses want to advertise on screens in your corridor. A dentist two blocks away. A yoga studio around the corner. A new restaurant opening next month.

You opt in. You set your rates. An advertiser books a lunch daypart at $10/day. You approve their ad — a clean image promoting teeth cleanings for new patients.

Their ad runs alongside your menu content during the lunch rush. Your customers see it. Some of them become the dentist's patients. The dentist is happy. You earned $200 this month from a TV that used to cost you $70.

**The revenue breakdown:**
- Advertiser pays: $10/day for lunch daypart
- You keep: 75% = $7.50/day
- Monthly (20 weekdays): $150 from one daypart
- Three dayparts filled: $450/month
- Minus your old cable bill you cancelled: +$70 saved
- **Net swing: $520/month better off**

And that's one screen. Some venues run two or three.

## The Screens Nobody Thinks About

Most people picture a TV behind the counter when they think about digital signage. But venue owners are finding screens in places they never considered:

**The waiting area.** If customers wait — for a table, an appointment, a service — a screen keeps them engaged and makes the wait feel shorter. It also shows them services or products they might not have known about.

**The window display.** A screen facing the sidewalk turns your storefront into a 24/7 promotion. Display your hours, featured items, and seasonal specials to every person who walks past, even when you're closed.

**The bathroom.** Sounds odd, but a small screen near the mirror in a restaurant or bar bathroom gets 30-60 seconds of undivided attention. Some of the highest engagement rates in venue advertising come from bathroom screens.

**The checkout area.** While customers wait to pay, a screen near the register promotes loyalty programs, upcoming events, retail products, or upsells. This is the equivalent of impulse buy shelving at a grocery store.

## You're Already Paying for the Screen

This is the simplest way to think about it:

You have a TV. It's plugged in. The electricity is running. Either it shows something that helps your business or it doesn't.

Right now, it probably doesn't. It shows content someone else created (CNN, ESPN, YouTube) that has nothing to do with your venue, your customers, or your corridor.

For $30 and 10 minutes, it can show *your* content. Your menu. Your schedule. Your story. Your community.

And if you want, it can pay you back.
