Gyms have screens everywhere. TVs on the cardio floor, monitors at the front desk, displays in the studio lobby. Most of them show ESPN or a muted cable channel nobody watches.

Those screens are wasted potential. Here's how fitness businesses are using digital signage to drive memberships, improve the member experience, and create a new revenue stream.

## Why Gyms Are a Perfect Fit for Digital Signage

Gyms have three things that make digital signage extremely effective:

**Long dwell times.** Members spend 45-90 minutes in your facility. That's 45-90 minutes of screen exposure—far more than a cafe or retail store.

**Captive audience on cardio equipment.** People on treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals stare at screens. They're literally positioned to watch. This is some of the most valuable screen time in any venue.

**Repetitive visits.** Members come 3-5 times per week. That's consistent, repeated exposure to your content. Advertisers love frequency.

## 6 Ways Gyms Use Digital Signage

### 1. Class Schedules That Update Automatically

Print class schedules on paper and they're outdated the moment an instructor calls in sick.

Digital class schedules update in real time. Cancel a class? It's removed from the screen immediately. Add a pop-up session? It appears across every display in the facility.

Display schedules at:
- The front desk (members check on arrival)
- Outside studio rooms (what's coming up next)
- The cardio floor (plan the rest of your workout)

### 2. Membership Promotions and Upsells

Your front desk TV should be selling, not showing SportsCenter.

Use it to promote:
- Current membership deals and referral bonuses
- Personal training packages
- Upcoming challenges or events
- New amenities or equipment
- Merchandise and supplements

Members who see promotions during their workout are in the right mindset to buy. They're already invested in fitness—show them the next step.

### 3. Workout Tips and Exercise Demos

Content that provides value keeps members engaged and builds loyalty.

Display:
- Exercise form tutorials (especially near free weights)
- Workout of the day
- Nutrition tips
- Recovery and mobility routines
- Trainer spotlights with their specialties

This type of content positions your gym as an authority and gives members reasons to look at your screens beyond just passing time.

### 4. Community and Social Proof

Gyms run on community. Use your screens to reinforce it:

- Member milestones ("Sarah hit 100 classes this month!")
- Before/after transformations (with permission)
- Social media feed showing tagged posts
- Event recaps and photos
- Staff introductions and certifications

Social proof content drives retention. When members see others achieving results, they stay motivated—and keep paying.

### 5. Sponsor and Advertiser Content

This is where your screens start making money.

Local businesses that want to reach your members:
- **Supplement brands** — Protein powders, pre-workouts, vitamins. Your members are their exact target market.
- **Athleisure and sportswear** — Local or online brands wanting gym visibility.
- **Health food restaurants** — Meal prep services, juice bars, health-focused cafes nearby.
- **Physical therapy and chiropractic** — Recovery services members actually need.
- **Sports events** — Local races, tournaments, fitness expos.
- **Wellness services** — Massage, acupuncture, cryotherapy studios.

A gym with 500+ active members can realistically charge $10-25 per daypart per screen. With 2-3 screens running ads, that's $200-750/month in additional revenue.

### 6. Emergency and Safety Information

Digital screens can instantly display:
- Weather alerts
- Equipment out-of-service notices
- Safety reminders
- Evacuation procedures
- Policy updates (mask requirements, capacity limits)

No reprinting. No walking around the facility taping up notices. Update once, display everywhere.

## Where to Place Screens in Your Gym

Screen placement matters. Here's where each type of content works best:

| Location | Best Content | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Front desk / lobby | Promotions, class schedule, welcome | First thing members see |
| Cardio floor | Ads, tips, social content | Long viewing time, captive audience |
| Free weight area | Exercise demos, form tips | Practical value while training |
| Studio entrance | Class schedule, instructor info | Decision point for class attendance |
| Locker room entrance | Promotions, events, sponsor ads | Members pausing between activities |
| Smoothie bar / cafe | Menu, nutrition info, food sponsor ads | Purchase decision point |

## Setting Up Digital Signage in Your Gym

### What You Need Per Screen

- **TV:** Use your existing TVs or add new ones ($150-400 each)
- **Media player:** Fire TV Stick ($30) or Raspberry Pi ($60)
- **WiFi connection:** Your existing gym WiFi
- **PiAds account:** Free—manage all screens from one dashboard

### Content Strategy for Gyms

A good gym signage rotation mixes your own content with ads:

**Morning (6am-11am)**
- Class schedule for the day
- Morning motivation quote or tip
- Breakfast/nutrition sponsor ad
- Membership referral promotion

**Midday (11am-3pm)**
- Lunch-hour class highlight
- Personal training promo
- Local health food sponsor ad
- Workout of the day

**Evening (4pm-9pm)**
- Evening class schedule
- Event or challenge announcements
- Supplement/sportswear sponsor ads
- Member spotlight or milestone

### Revenue Potential

| Gym Size | Screens | Monthly Ad Revenue (Est.) |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| Small studio (100 members) | 1-2 | $50-150 |
| Mid-size gym (300 members) | 2-4 | $150-500 |
| Large facility (500+ members) | 4-8 | $400-1,500 |

These numbers assume moderate ad fill rates. Gyms in urban areas with higher foot traffic can charge more per slot.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will ads annoy my members?

Not if you do it right. Keep ads relevant (fitness, health, local services), limit ad frequency (no more than 30% of screen time), and always prioritize your own content. Members expect to see promotions in a gym—as long as the content is useful and not overwhelming.

### What screen size works best for a gym?

43-55" for most areas. Cardio floors benefit from larger screens (55-65") since members view from a distance. Front desk and studio entrances work well with 32-43" displays.

### Can I manage all my screens from one place?

Yes. With PiAds, you manage every screen in your facility from a single dashboard. Create different playlists for different screen locations and schedule content by time of day.

### How do I get advertisers for my gym screens?

List your screens on the PiAds marketplace. Local businesses can discover your venue, see your member demographics, and book ad slots directly. You approve every ad before it runs.

### Can I show different content on different screens?

Yes. Each screen gets its own playlist. Show class schedules near studios, workout tips near free weights, and promotions at the front desk—all managed from one account.

## Getting Started

Digital signage in a gym isn't just about replacing cable TV. It's about turning passive screens into tools that improve the member experience, drive revenue, and strengthen your brand.

Start with one screen—your front desk TV is the easiest. Connect a Fire TV Stick, set up a playlist with your class schedule and a few promotions, and see the response. Most gyms expand to additional screens within the first month.
