You've got a screen. Maybe it's the TV behind your bar that cycles through sports highlights. Maybe it's the display in your salon waiting area showing slideshows. Or maybe it's just sitting there, turned off, waiting for a purpose.

Whatever the case, that screen can start earning you money today. And it takes less than 10 minutes to set up.

This guide walks you through connecting your first screen to PiAds, step by step.

## Before You Start

You'll need two things: a screen and an internet connection.

PiAds works with almost any display that can open a web browser. That includes smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV Sticks, Raspberry Pi devices, and even your existing digital signage setup if you're already using something like ScreenCloud or Yodeck.

If your screen can load a webpage, you're good to go.

## Step 1: Create Your PiAds Account

Head over to [piads.co](https://piads.co) and sign up. The process takes about two minutes.

You'll enter your business name, address, and a few details about your venue. This information helps advertisers understand who visits your location, which means better ad matches and higher booking rates down the line.

Once your account is created, you'll land on your dashboard. This is where you'll manage everything—screens, playlists, schedules, and payouts.

## Step 2: Add Your Screen

From your dashboard, click "Add Screen" and give it a name. Something descriptive works best. "Front Window Display" tells you a lot more than "Screen 1" when you're managing multiple locations.

You'll also specify the screen's orientation—landscape or portrait—and its operating hours. If your coffee shop closes at 6pm, there's no point running ads at midnight.

That's all the information PiAds needs to get started.

## Step 3: Connect Your Screen

Here's where the magic happens.

After adding your screen in the dashboard, PiAds generates a six-digit pairing code. Now you need to enter that code on your actual screen.

On your TV or display device, open a web browser and go to **p.piads.co**. The page will show a large pairing code. Take note of it, then head back to your PiAds dashboard and enter the code where prompted.

That's it. Your screen is now connected.

The whole process takes about 30 seconds once you know what you're doing. No apps to install, no special hardware to configure, no IT department required.

## Step 4: Set Up Your Content

Your screen is connected, but what should it show?

PiAds lets you create playlists—collections of images, videos, and other content that play in rotation. You might create a playlist with your menu, daily specials, and a few branded graphics.

You can also set up schedules to control when different content plays. Morning playlist for the breakfast crowd, lunch playlist when things pick up, evening playlist for the dinner rush.

When advertisers book your screen, their content automatically slots into your rotation. You don't have to lift a finger. And you always have final approval on what runs—if an ad doesn't fit your venue, you can reject it.

## Step 5: Go Live

Once your content is set up, toggle your screen to "Live" in the marketplace.

Advertisers can now discover your screen, see your pricing, and book time slots. You'll get notified whenever someone wants to run an ad, and you can approve or reject each request.

Payments happen automatically. PiAds handles the transaction, and your earnings show up in your account. Payouts are processed monthly.

## What Happens Next

Your screen is now part of the PiAds network. Advertisers looking to reach customers in your area will find your listing, see your venue photos and foot traffic estimates, and book campaigns.

You keep showing your own content. Ads appear alongside it—not instead of it. Your screen keeps doing what it always did, except now it's also generating revenue.

Some venue owners earn enough to cover their monthly streaming subscriptions. Others turn their screens into a meaningful revenue stream. It depends on your location, foot traffic, and how you price your inventory.

But it all starts with that first screen.
