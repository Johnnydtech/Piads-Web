You don't need expensive commercial media players to run professional digital signage. A $30 Fire TV Stick, a $60 Raspberry Pi, or an old Android tablet can do the job just fine.

But which one should you actually use? Each has real tradeoffs in reliability, cost, setup difficulty, and features. Here's an honest comparison to help you choose.

## The Quick Answer

| | Raspberry Pi | Fire TV Stick | Android TV/Tablet |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $60-80 | $25-50 | $50-200+ |
| **Best for** | 24/7 permanent displays | Quick budget setup | Interactive/touch displays |
| **Reliability** | Excellent | Good | Good |
| **Setup difficulty** | Easy (flash SD card) | Easiest (plug and play) | Easy (install app) |
| **Audio support** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Touch support** | With add-on | No | Built-in (tablets) |
| **Kiosk mode** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Power consumption** | ~5W | ~5W | Varies |

Still not sure? Read on for the full breakdown.

## Raspberry Pi: The Reliability Champion

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny single-board computer about the size of a credit card. It plugs into any TV or monitor via HDMI and runs a dedicated signage operating system.

### Why choose Raspberry Pi

**Built for 24/7 operation.** The Pi has no moving parts, no fan, and uses minimal power. It's designed to run continuously without overheating or slowing down. Venues that need screens running all day, every day—restaurants, retail stores, waiting rooms—get the most reliable experience with a Pi.

**Dedicated device.** Unlike a Fire TV Stick that might get system updates or app notifications, a Pi running PiAds does one thing: display your content. No distractions, no surprises.

**Full control.** The Pi boots directly into your signage content. No home screen, no app store, no system UI getting in the way. It behaves like a purpose-built appliance.

**Ethernet support.** WiFi is fine for most setups, but if you need rock-solid connectivity, the Pi 4 and Pi 5 have built-in ethernet ports. Hardwired connections mean no WiFi dropouts.

### Downsides

- Slightly higher upfront cost (~$60-80 for board + case + power supply + SD card)
- Requires flashing an SD card during setup (takes 5 minutes with free tools)
- Need a separate HDMI cable

### Best for

Permanent installations where reliability matters. Restaurants, retail, lobbies, gyms—anywhere the screen runs 8+ hours daily and you don't want to think about it.

## Fire TV Stick: The Budget King

Amazon's Fire TV Stick is a streaming device that plugs directly into your TV's HDMI port. With the PiAds app installed, it becomes a capable digital signage player for a fraction of the cost.

### Why choose Fire TV Stick

**Cheapest option.** A Fire TV Stick Lite costs around $25-30. Even the 4K version is under $50. If you're testing digital signage or running a tight budget, this is the lowest barrier to entry.

**Plug and play.** It literally plugs into your TV. Connect to WiFi, install the PiAds app, and you're running. The entire setup takes under 5 minutes.

**Available everywhere.** You can buy one at any electronics store or order from Amazon with next-day delivery. No waiting for specialty hardware to ship.

**Compact and hidden.** The stick hides behind your TV. No visible hardware, no cables running to a separate device (besides power).

### Downsides

- No ethernet without an adapter (WiFi only on base models)
- Amazon system updates can occasionally interrupt
- Less processing power than Raspberry Pi 5
- No GPIO or hardware expansion options

### Best for

Budget setups, testing digital signage before committing, secondary screens, or venues that want the simplest possible installation.

## Android TV / Android Tablet: The Versatile Option

Any Android device running version 8 or later can run the PiAds app. This includes Android TV boxes, smart TVs with Android built in, and Android tablets.

### Why choose Android

**Use what you already have.** Got an old Android tablet in a drawer? A smart TV with Android built in? You might not need to buy anything at all.

**Touch support.** If you want interactive signage—a touch menu, a check-in kiosk, or a QR code display that customers can interact with—an Android tablet gives you a touchscreen out of the box.

**Variety of form factors.** Wall-mounted tablets, countertop displays, freestanding kiosks. Android hardware comes in more shapes and sizes than Pi or Fire TV.

**Built-in display.** Tablets don't need a separate screen. For small countertop signage or table displays, a tablet is an all-in-one solution.

### Downsides

- Quality varies wildly between manufacturers
- Cheap Android boxes can be unreliable for 24/7 use
- System notifications and updates can interfere
- Higher power consumption than Pi or Fire TV Stick

### Best for

Interactive displays, countertop signage, venues that already have Android hardware, or situations where you need a built-in screen (tablets).

## Real-World Recommendations

Here's what we'd suggest based on common venue scenarios:

**Coffee shop with one TV behind the counter:**
Fire TV Stick. Cheap, easy, gets the job done. Upgrade to Pi later if you want more reliability.

**Restaurant with 3-5 screens running all day:**
Raspberry Pi. The reliability pays for itself when you're not troubleshooting screens during the lunch rush.

**Retail store with a window display:**
Raspberry Pi. It'll run 24/7 without attention, even when the store is closed and nobody's around to restart it.

**Salon with a tablet in the waiting area:**
Android tablet. Clients can browse services, and you can show promotions between interactions.

**Bar with multiple TVs showing mixed content:**
Fire TV Stick for the ones showing sports/streaming, Raspberry Pi for the dedicated signage screens.

**Pop-up shop or temporary installation:**
Fire TV Stick. Easy to set up, easy to take down, cheap enough that it doesn't matter if something happens to it.

## What About Commercial Media Players?

You'll see companies selling dedicated "digital signage media players" for $200-800+. These are Android boxes or mini PCs in fancy enclosures with enterprise software pre-installed.

For most small businesses, they're unnecessary. A $60 Raspberry Pi with PiAds gives you the same reliability and features at a quarter of the price. The commercial players make sense for large enterprise deployments where IT departments need centralized hardware management. For a cafe with 1-3 screens? Save your money.

## Can You Mix and Match?

Yes. PiAds works across all three platforms. You can run a Raspberry Pi on your main display, a Fire TV Stick on a secondary screen, and an Android tablet on the counter. They all connect to the same dashboard, show the same playlists, and earn advertising revenue the same way.

This flexibility is actually one of the biggest advantages. Start with whatever you have, upgrade individual screens when it makes sense, and never worry about being locked into one hardware vendor.

## Getting Started

Whichever device you choose, setup takes about 10 minutes:

1. **Raspberry Pi** — Flash the PiAds image to an SD card, insert, power on
2. **Fire TV Stick** — Install the PiAds app from the Downloader app
3. **Android** — Install the PiAds app

All three show a pairing code on screen. Enter it in your [PiAds dashboard](https://piads.co), and your screen is connected.

No monthly hardware fees. No proprietary equipment. Just a screen, a player, and an internet connection.
