You bought the screen. You plugged in the media player. Now it's sitting there showing a static logo on loop, and nobody's looking at it.

The hardware is the easy part. The content is what makes digital signage work or fail. Here are 10 content ideas that actually hold attention and drive results.

## 1. Live Social Media Feeds

Pull your Instagram, TikTok, or Google Reviews onto the screen. This does three things:

- Shows real social proof (actual customers posting about you)
- Encourages more posts (people want to see themselves on the big screen)
- Keeps content fresh without you creating anything new

A restaurant showing its latest Instagram posts with customer food photos generates more engagement than any stock image ever will.

**Pro tip:** Curate your feed rather than showing everything live. You want to filter out anything off-brand before it hits the screen.

## 2. Countdown Timers and Limited Offers

Urgency works. A countdown timer on screen creates action:

- "Happy hour starts in 2:14:30"
- "Flash sale ends today"
- "Only 3 spots left in tonight's class"
- "Grand opening in 5 days"

The ticking clock catches eyes and creates a reason to act now rather than later. Even something as simple as counting down to your lunch special drives orders.

## 3. Behind-the-Scenes Content

People love seeing how things are made. Show:

- Your barista pulling a latte (for a cafe)
- Your chef prepping fresh ingredients (for a restaurant)
- A trainer demonstrating a new workout (for a gym)
- Your team setting up for an event

Behind-the-scenes content builds trust and makes your business feel authentic. It takes 30 seconds to film on your phone and can run for weeks.

## 4. Customer Testimonials and Reviews

Take your best Google or Yelp reviews and put them on screen. A simple design with the review text, star rating, and reviewer's first name is all you need.

Rotate through 5-10 reviews. Seeing "Best coffee in the neighborhood - Sarah M. ★★★★★" on a screen carries more weight than the same review buried on page 2 of Google.

**What works:**
- Keep reviews short (1-2 sentences)
- Include the star rating visually
- Rotate every 15-20 seconds
- Update monthly with fresh reviews

## 5. Dayparted Menus and Promotions

If you serve food or drinks, your screen content should change throughout the day:

**Morning:** Coffee menu, breakfast specials, fresh pastry photos
**Lunch:** Sandwich/entrée menu, combo deals, quick lunch options
**Afternoon:** Snack menu, happy hour countdown, afternoon specials
**Evening:** Dinner menu, wine/cocktail list, chef's special

This isn't just about showing the right menu—it's about showing the right promotion at the right time. Your $5 morning coffee deal doesn't need screen time at 7pm.

## 6. Local Weather and Contextual Info

A current weather display does something important: it proves your screen is live, not just a loop.

When customers see today's actual weather on screen, they trust that all the other content is current too. It's a credibility signal.

Take it further with contextual content:
- Rainy day? Promote your soup or hot drinks
- Hot afternoon? Highlight cold brew or smoothies
- Friday evening? Show weekend event listings
- Game day? Display the score or schedule

Weather-triggered content feels personal and relevant, which is exactly what keeps eyes on screens.

## 7. Staff Introductions and Spotlights

Put faces to your business. A simple slide with a staff photo, name, role, and a fun fact humanizes your venue.

- "Meet Alex — Lead Barista. Favorite drink: Oat milk cortado. Here since 2023."
- "Trainer of the month: Jessica. Specialty: HIIT and mobility. Book a session at the front desk."

This content builds connection between staff and customers. It also makes your team feel valued, which improves retention.

## 8. Event Announcements and Community Boards

Your screen is the most visible bulletin board in your venue. Use it for:

- Upcoming events at your venue
- Local community events (farmers markets, charity runs, festivals)
- Live music or entertainment schedules
- Workshop or class announcements
- Seasonal promotions

A digital community board positions your venue as a neighborhood hub. It gives customers a reason to check the screen regularly because they might learn about something happening nearby.

## 9. Interactive QR Codes

Add QR codes to your signage content that link to:

- Your online ordering menu
- A review page (ask for reviews at the right moment)
- A signup form (email list, loyalty program, class booking)
- A special offer or discount code
- Your social media profiles

QR codes bridge the gap between your screen and the customer's phone. They turn passive viewing into active engagement. A QR code that says "Scan to get 10% off your next visit" gives people a reason to interact.

**Best practices:**
- Make QR codes large enough to scan from a distance
- Always include a short text description of where the code leads
- Test the code on your own phone before going live
- Track scans to measure engagement

## 10. Curated News or Industry Content

Show content that's relevant to your audience and venue:

- **Gym:** Fitness news, nutrition studies, sports highlights
- **Cafe:** Coffee origin stories, food trends, local news
- **Salon:** Style trends, hair care tips, beauty news
- **Office/coworking:** Industry news, productivity tips, tech updates

This type of content gives people a reason to watch your screen beyond just promotions. It provides value, which makes them more receptive when a promotional slide does appear.

## Content Mistakes to Avoid

### Too much text

If someone can't read it in 5 seconds, it's too much. Use short headlines, bullet points, and visuals. Save the paragraphs for your website.

### Stale content

Content that hasn't changed in weeks tells customers you don't care. Update at least weekly. Even small changes—a new review, an updated special—keep things fresh.

### No call to action

Every piece of content should have a purpose. "Try our new cold brew" is better than just a photo of cold brew. Tell people what you want them to do.

### All promotions, no value

If every slide is trying to sell something, people tune out. Mix promotional content (30-40%) with informational and entertaining content (60-70%). The value content earns attention for the promotions.

### Poor image quality

Blurry photos and pixelated graphics look worse on a big screen than on a phone. Use high-resolution images. If you're taking photos on your phone, make sure the lighting is good and the subject is in focus.

## Building a Content Rotation

A good content loop runs 3-5 minutes and includes a mix of content types. Here's a sample rotation for a cafe:

| Slide | Content Type | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Menu (dayparted) | 15 sec |
| 2 | Daily special with photo | 10 sec |
| 3 | Customer review | 10 sec |
| 4 | Local ad (revenue) | 15 sec |
| 5 | Behind-the-scenes photo | 10 sec |
| 6 | Event announcement | 10 sec |
| 7 | QR code offer | 15 sec |
| 8 | Local ad (revenue) | 15 sec |
| 9 | Social media post | 10 sec |
| 10 | Staff spotlight | 10 sec |

Total loop: ~2 minutes. This means each piece of content shows about 30 times during a 60-minute visit—enough repetition to register without becoming annoying.

## Getting Started

You don't need all 10 content types on day one. Start with three:

1. **Your menu or core service offering** (what you sell)
2. **One piece of social proof** (review or social media post)
3. **One promotion or CTA** (what you want customers to do)

Add more content types over time as you see what resonates. The key is to start showing something useful and iterate from there.
