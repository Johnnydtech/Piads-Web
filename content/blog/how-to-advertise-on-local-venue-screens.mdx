You've seen the screens. The TV behind the counter at your favorite lunch spot. The display in the gym lobby. The monitor in the barbershop waiting area.

Those screens are available for advertising. And for local businesses, they're one of the most effective—and affordable—ways to reach customers in your neighborhood.

Here's how to get your business on those screens.

## Why Venue Screens Work for Local Advertising

Before we get into the how, here's why this channel is worth your attention:

**You can't skip or block it.** Unlike online ads, a screen on the wall is always visible. No ad blockers. No scrolling past. No "skip in 5 seconds."

**The audience is captive.** People in a cafe spend 20-45 minutes looking around. Gym members are on treadmills for 30+ minutes. Salon clients sit for 45-90 minutes. Your ad gets real viewing time.

**It's hyperlocal.** You choose the specific venues where your ad runs. Advertise in the coffee shop next door to your business. Put your ad in the gym where your ideal customers work out. Target by neighborhood, not by zip code.

**It's affordable.** Venue screen advertising starts at $50-75/week. Compare that to:
- Google Ads: $500-2,000/month for competitive local keywords
- Facebook Ads: $300-1,000/month for meaningful local reach
- Direct mail: $500-2,000 per campaign
- Local newspaper: $200-1,000 per ad placement

## Step 1: Define Your Goal

Before you book screen time, decide what you want the ad to accomplish:

- **Awareness:** You just opened and want the neighborhood to know you exist. Focus on your name, what you do, and where you are.
- **Foot traffic:** You want people to walk in. Include your address, a reason to visit today, and maybe a first-visit offer.
- **Lead generation:** You want phone calls, emails, or bookings. Include a QR code, phone number, or website.
- **Promotion:** You're running a sale, event, or limited offer. Make the offer clear with a deadline.

Your goal determines your creative and where you place the ad.

## Step 2: Choose Your Venues

Not every venue is right for every business. Match your ad placement to your target customer:

| Your Business | Best Venue Types |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Restaurant / food truck | Gyms, offices, coworking spaces |
| Personal trainer / gym | Cafes, health food stores, wellness studios |
| Real estate agent | Coffee shops, coworking, family restaurants |
| Dentist / doctor | Family restaurants, gyms, salons |
| Home services (plumber, electrician) | Cafes, barbershops, hardware stores |
| Retail store | Nearby restaurants, salons, gyms |
| Event / festival | Cafes, bars, gyms, community spaces |
| Professional services (lawyer, CPA) | Coworking spaces, upscale cafes |

On PiAds, you can browse available venues by location and see details about foot traffic, screen placement, and audience before booking.

## Step 3: Choose Your Dayparts

Venue screens divide the day into time blocks called dayparts. Each daypart reaches a different audience:

**Breakfast (7am-11am)**
- Who's there: Morning commuters, remote workers, early exercisers
- Best for: Coffee shops, breakfast spots, productivity tools, professional services

**Lunch (11am-3pm)**
- Who's there: Lunch crowd, afternoon shoppers, midday gym-goers
- Best for: Restaurants, retail, delivery services, quick-service businesses

**Evening (5pm-10pm)**
- Who's there: After-work crowd, dinner guests, evening class attendees
- Best for: Entertainment, events, restaurants, bars, wellness services

You don't need to book all dayparts. A lunch restaurant should book morning dayparts in nearby offices (reach people before they decide where to eat). A bar promoting happy hour should book the afternoon daypart.

## Step 4: Create Your Ad

Venue screen ads are simpler than you think. You're not producing a TV commercial. Most venue screens display static images or simple short videos in rotation.

### What Makes an Effective Venue Screen Ad

**Keep text minimal.** People glance at screens for 3-10 seconds at a time. Your ad needs to communicate in that window.

Good: "Fresh Sushi. 2 blocks away. Lunch special $12.99"
Bad: "Welcome to Tokyo Garden, where we've been serving authentic Japanese cuisine to the community since 2015. Our expert chefs use only the freshest ingredients..."

**Use one clear visual.** A photo of your product, your storefront, or your team. One image, not a collage.

**Include your location or proximity.** "Right around the corner" or "123 Main St, 2 min walk" tells people you're close and convenient.

**Add a call to action.** Tell people what to do:
- "Visit us today"
- "Scan to book"
- "Call 555-0123"
- "Use code SCREEN15 for 15% off"

**Consider adding a QR code.** A QR code bridges the gap between the screen and the customer's phone. Link it to your website, booking page, or a special offer.

### Ad Formats

Most venue screens accept:
- **Images:** JPEG or PNG, 1920x1080 pixels (landscape)
- **Video:** MP4, 15-30 seconds, no audio (venue screens typically run muted)

### Creating Your Ad Without a Designer

You don't need a graphic designer:
- **Canva (free):** Search "digital signage" templates and customize with your branding
- **Your phone:** Take a high-quality photo of your product or storefront and add text overlay in Canva
- **Keep it simple:** A clean design with your logo, one photo, and a short message outperforms a cluttered design every time

## Step 5: Book and Launch

On PiAds, the booking process takes a few minutes:

1. Sign up and select "Advertiser"
2. Browse venues in your area
3. Select the screens and dayparts you want
4. Upload your creative
5. Set your budget and dates
6. Submit for venue owner approval

Venue owners review and approve ads to ensure they're appropriate for their space. Most approvals happen within 24 hours.

## Step 6: Measure Results

Track your ad performance through:

- **Play counts:** How many times your ad ran on each screen
- **QR code scans:** If you included a QR code, track how many people scanned it
- **Promo code redemptions:** Use a screen-specific code to track conversions
- **Direct inquiries:** "How did you hear about us?" at checkout captures attribution
- **Foot traffic:** Compare store visits during your campaign to your baseline

Digital venue advertising isn't like online ads where you can track every click. But the combination of play counts, promo codes, and direct inquiries gives you a reasonable picture of ROI.

## What Results to Expect

Set realistic expectations:

**Week 1-2:** Awareness builds. People in the venue start noticing your ad. Don't expect immediate foot traffic unless you're running a strong offer.

**Week 3-4:** Recognition kicks in. Repeat visitors (gym members, daily coffee shop customers) have seen your ad multiple times. This is when they start acting on it.

**Month 2+:** If the venue and ad are working, you'll see consistent results. Consider expanding to additional venues or testing new creative.

Local venue advertising is a frequency game. Unlike a one-time flyer or a single social media ad, your venue screen ad runs hundreds of times per week. Repetition builds familiarity, and familiarity drives action.

## Budgeting for Venue Screen Advertising

| Budget | What You Get |
|--------|-------------|
| $50-75/week | 1 screen, 1 daypart. Good for testing |
| $150-200/week | 1-2 screens, multiple dayparts. Solid local presence |
| $400-500/week | 3-5 screens across venues. Neighborhood-level coverage |
| $1,000+/week | 10+ screens. Market-level presence |

Start small. Book one screen in one venue for a month. Evaluate results. Then expand to more venues if it's working.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I run my ads?

Give it at least 4 weeks. Venue advertising builds through repetition. A one-week test won't give you meaningful data because many venue visitors are on weekly cycles (e.g., gym members who come every Tuesday and Thursday).

### Can I change my ad creative during a campaign?

Yes. You can update your ad at any time through the PiAds dashboard. If a promotion ends or you want to test different messaging, swap it out.

### What if my ad gets rejected by a venue owner?

Venue owners approve ads to make sure they fit their space. If your ad is rejected, you'll get feedback. Common reasons: inappropriate content, competitor products, or poor image quality. Update and resubmit.

### Do I need different ads for different venues?

Not necessarily, but it can help. A generic ad works fine across venues. But an ad that says "2 blocks from this gym" performs better than one that says "Visit us in downtown Arlington."

### Can I advertise a business that isn't local?

Yes, but venue screen advertising works best for businesses within walking or short driving distance of the venue. The closer you are, the more likely viewers are to visit.

### How do I know which venues are right for my business?

Think about where your target customers spend time. A fitness supplement brand belongs in gym screens. A lunch spot belongs on screens in nearby offices and gyms. Browse PiAds venues by location and audience type to find the best fit.
